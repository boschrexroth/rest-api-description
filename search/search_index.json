What is OpenAPI? \u00b6 From the OpenAPI Specification : The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service. List of OpenAPI Descriptions \u00b6 Area Description ctrlX CORE ctrlX CORE related rest api descriptions ctrlX WORKS ctrlX WORKS related rest api descriptions NOTE: Only REST API descriptions in this repository are considered stable and can be used by applications. Other APIs and http calls (e.g. reverse engineered) that are not official documented in this repository can not be considered in a stable state and might break in the future. They should not be used. Important directions for use \u00b6 Areas of use and application \u00b6 The content (e.g. source code and related documents) of this repository is intended to be used for configuration, parameterization, programming or diagnostics in combination with selected Bosch Rexroth ctrlX AUTOMATION devices. Additionally, the specifications given in the \"Areas of Use and Application\" for ctrlX AUTOMATION devices used with the content of this repository do also apply. Unintended use \u00b6 Any use of the source code and related documents of this repository in applications other than those specified above or under operating conditions other than those described in the documentation and the technical specifications is considered as \"unintended\".
