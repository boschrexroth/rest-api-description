When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#list-of-openapi-descriptions","title":"List of OpenAPI Descriptions","text":"Area Description ctrlX CORE ctrlX CORE related rest api descriptions ctrlX WORKS ctrlX WORKS related rest api descriptions <p>NOTE: Only REST API descriptions in this repository are considered stable and can be used by applications.
