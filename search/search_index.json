What is OpenAPI? \u00b6 From the OpenAPI Specification : The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service. List of OpenAPI Descriptions \u00b6 Area Description ctrlX CORE ctrlX CORE related rest api descriptions ctrlX WORKS ctrlX WORKS related rest api descriptions NOTE: Only REST API descriptions in this repository are considered stable and can be used by applications. Other APIs and http calls (e.g. reverse engineered) that are not official documented in this repository can not be considered in a stable state and might break in the future. They should not be used. Important directions for use \u00b6 Areas of use and application \u00b6 The content (e.g. source code and related documents) of this repository is intended to be used for configuration, parameterization, programming or diagnostics in combination with selected Bosch Rexroth ctrlX AUTOMATION devices. Additionally, the specifications given in the \"Areas of Use and Application\" for ctrlX AUTOMATION devices used with the content of this repository do also apply. Unintended use \u00b6 Any use of the source code and related documents of this repository in applications other than those specified above or under operating conditions other than those described in the documentation and the technical specifications is considered as \"unintended\".

Our Standards \u00b6 Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: Using welcoming and inclusive language Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accepting constructive criticism Focusing on what is best for the community Showing empathy towards other community members Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Our Responsibilities \u00b6 Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Scope \u00b6 This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers. Enforcement \u00b6 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at github@boschrexroth.com . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
