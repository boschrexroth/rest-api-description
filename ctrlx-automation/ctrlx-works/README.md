# Rest api descriptions for ctrlX WORKS

The ctrlX WORKS engineering platform is designed as an open platform to encourage developers to develop third-party apps and services.
As part of this goal we publish all released REST-APIs as OpenAPI description on github. You can use it to generate clients using
third-party generators or browse our interactive API documentation.

In the list below, you will find the latest released versions of our apis. The first column contains a link to the interactive API documentation.
The link in the second column will open the actual openAPI as json.
